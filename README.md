### About this Dissertation
Crowd simulation is concerned with creating models of how groups of people move. This
Dissertation is focused on creating a model of dense crowd flow through deep reinforcement
learning. At the time of writing, to the best of the authors knowledge, no one has simulated
dense crowd flow with deep reinforcement learning. The model was developed in
[Unity](https://unity.com/) using the package [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).
### Details of Submission
This project was submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of
MComp (Hons) Computer Science at the University of Sheffield by William R Shaw
